Numerical Analysis
How to Implement Math in C++
Here are the list of Methods implemented by me in C++
1) Aitken Method
2) Euler Method
3) Euler Modified Method
4) Euler Improved Method
5) Rungee Kutta 2nd order Formula
6) Rungee Kutta 3rd order Formula
7) Rungee Kutta 4th order Formula
8) Langrange Method
9) Trapizodal Method of Integration
10) Simsun 1/3 Method of Integration
11) Simsun 3/8 Mehod of Integration

I hope these will help you students of Computer Science and others who want to know how to implement math in programming.

Happy Coding :-)
